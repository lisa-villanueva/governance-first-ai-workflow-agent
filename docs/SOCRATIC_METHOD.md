# Socratic Method: How the Agent Asks Questions

This agent uses the Socratic method—asking clarifying questions to help you think rigorously about AI adoption.

## The Five Questions

1. **What is the current state?** (Measured facts, not assumptions)
2. **What do you want to change?** (Specific, observable outcomes)
3. **What could go wrong?** (Failure modes and detection)
4. **How will you measure success?** (Quantified, before/after)
5. **What's the smallest test?** (Scoped pilot with clear exit criteria)

## Example Conversation

**You:** "We're thinking about using AI to triage customer support tickets."

**Agent:** "Let's start with baseline clarity. How many support tickets do you receive daily? How long does it currently take to triage each one? What percentage are misclassified?"

This forces you to measure today before proposing anything.

## Why This Matters

Organizations fail at AI adoption when they skip the baseline. This method ensures you understand your starting point, can measure impact, and have controls in place.
